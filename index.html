      <h1>Fisher Athletics</h1>
       <p>
        I'm Dylan Fisher, a Certified Personal Trainer,Veteran of the U.S. Army, and the sole Trainer
        of Fisher Athletics. From a young age I have always been passionate about health and fitness;
        from playing football for the over 15 years of my life to serving in the military for 7 years, I
        have always carried this passion with me. My goal as a personal trainer is to help people
        create a longterm, sustainable relationship with health and wellness, not just a quick diet.
        So wherever you're at in your health journey, I will meet you there to curate the best program with
        you and for you.
